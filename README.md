# learndari
A language-learning app for the language, Dari, which is spoken by a total of two and a half million people in Iran, Pakistan, and neighboring regions.
This is an app that I am currently making for android with Java, when done, I will port it to iOS. Keep in mind that this app is a work in progress, and most files are unused for now, and there are a lot of comments intended for myself. 

# I work on this app frequently, but I do it on my local computer, so this repository will always be behind on updates. I try my best to keep it up to date here. This repository is currently being replaced with new files once every few weeks.
